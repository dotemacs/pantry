# `pantry`

A Common Lisp client library for the [Pantry JSON storage
service](https://getpantry.cloud).

## Usage

Pantry, stores JSON data in objects which it calls `baskets`.

You can store JSON data in them like so:

```lisp
CL-USER> (pantry:create-basket *client* "user-settings"
                      '(("theme" . "dark")
                        ("language" . "en")
                        ("notifications" . t)
                        ("user-id" . 12345)))
"Your Pantry was updated with basket: user-settings!"
```

Or get the data out:

```lisp
(pantry:get-basket *client* "user-settings")
;; => a hash-table
```

You can also update your basket:

```lisp
(pantry:update-basket *client* "user-settings"
                      '(("theme" . "light")
                        ("last-login" . "2023-12-01")))
;; => merged basket contents as a hash-table
```
which merges your existing data with the new data.

Or you can delete it:

```lisp
(pantry:delete-basket *client* "user-settings")
;; Returns: "user-settings was removed from your Pantry!"
```

The place where all these baskets sit within Pantry, the service, is
called pantry, the object, which you can look up:

```lisp
(gethash "baskets" (pantry:get-pantry-details *client*))
```

To make it easier to work with data, You can pass many Common Lisp
data structures and theyâ€™ll be converted to JSON automatically. Basket
payloads must be JSON objects and you pass a non-object (like a list
or vector), it is wrapped as {"value": ...}  to satisfy the API.


## Installation

### 1. Install Dependencies

```lisp
(ql:quickload '(:dexador :jonathan))
```

### 2. Load the Library

**Option A: Using ASDF (recommended)**
```lisp
;; Add the pantry directory to ASDF's search path
(push #P"/path/to/pantry/" asdf:*central-registry*)

;; Load the system
(asdf:load-system :pantry)
```

**Option B: Manual loading**
```lisp
;; Single-file system: just load pantry.lisp
(load "/path/to/pantry/pantry.lisp")
```

### 3. Get Your Pantry ID

Visit [getpantry.cloud](https://getpantry.cloud) to get your free pantry ID.

## Usage

### Creating a Client

```lisp
(defparameter *client* (pantry:make-pantry-client "your-pantry-id-here"))
```

### Pantry Operations

#### Get Pantry Details
Get information about your pantry, including available baskets:

```lisp
(pantry:get-pantry-details *client*)
;; => a hash-table mapping string keys to values
;; Example access:
(let ((details (pantry:get-pantry-details *client*)))
  (gethash "baskets" details))
```

### Data structures that you can use

#### Hash-table
```lisp
(let ((ht (make-hash-table :test 'equal)))
  (setf (gethash :theme ht) :dark
        (gethash "language" ht) "en"
        (gethash 'notifications ht) t)
  (pantry:create-basket *client* "ht-basket" ht))
```

#### Plist -> JSON object
```lisp
(pantry:create-basket *client* "plist-basket"
                      '(:theme :dark :language "en" :notifications t))
```

#### Vector / list wrapped under "value"
```lisp
(pantry:create-basket *client* "array-basket" #(1 2 3 4))
;; Sends {"value": [1,2,3,4]}

(pantry:create-basket *client* "list-basket"  '(:a :b :c))
;; Sends {"value": ["a","b","c"]}
```

#### Dotted pair -> single-entry object
```lisp
(pantry:create-basket *client* "pair-basket"  '(foo . 42))
```

#### Nested structures are fine too

```lisp
(pantry:create-basket *client* "nested"
  '((user . ((id . 1) (name . "Ada")))
    (prefs . (:theme :dark :langs #("en" "fr")))))
```


## Error Handling

The library defines custom conditions for error handling:

```lisp
;; Catch all pantry errors
(handler-case
    (pantry:get-basket *client* "non-existent-basket")
  (pantry:pantry-error (e)
    (format t "Error: ~A~%" (pantry:pantry-error-message e))))

;; Catch HTTP-specific errors
(handler-case
    (pantry:create-basket *client* "test" invalid-data)
  (pantry:pantry-http-error (e)
    (format t "HTTP ~A: ~A~%"
            (pantry:pantry-http-error-status-code e)
            (pantry:pantry-error-message e))))
```
